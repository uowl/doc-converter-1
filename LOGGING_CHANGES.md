# Logging Changes Summary

## Overview
The logging configuration has been updated to reduce verbosity and focus on progress bars for a cleaner user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Log Level Configuration
- **File**: `config.py`
- **Change**: `LOG_LEVEL` changed from `"INFO"` to `"DEBUG"`
- **Impact**: All logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) are now visible

### 2. Verbose Operations Moved to DEBUG Level
The following operations now use DEBUG level instead of INFO level:

#### File Operations (blob_monitor.py)
- Download operations: `"Downloaded {blob_name} to {local_path}"`
- Upload operations: `"Uploaded {local_path} as {blob_name}"`
- Delete operations: `"Deleted trigger file from Azure config folder"`
- Local file uploads: `"Uploaded local file {local_path} as {dest_blob_path}"`

#### Processing Operations (multi_thread_processor.py)
- File cleanup: `"Deleted downloaded file to conserve space"`
- Processed file cleanup: `"Cleaned up local processed file"`
- Success messages: `"Successfully converted and uploaded"`
- Individual file processing: `"Processing document: {filename}"`

#### Document Conversion (document_converter.py)
- Temporary file cleanup: `"Cleaned up temporary file: {file_path}"`

#### Trigger File Validation (trigger_file_handler.py)
- SAS URL validation details: `"SAS URL validation successful"`
- Container and path information

#### Batch Processing (batch_processor.py)
- Memory cleanup messages: `"Memory cleanup completed, ready for next batch"`

#### Main Application (main.py)
- Job log upload: `"Uploaded job log to {dest_blob_path}"`

### 3. Important Messages Remain at INFO Level
The following important status messages remain at INFO level:
- Application startup and configuration
- Batch processing status and statistics
- Multi-threading configuration
- Progress bar configuration
- Document conversion success/failure summaries
- Error messages (ERROR level)
- Trigger file parsing results

### 4. Progress Bars Remain Independent
Progress bars work independently of the logging level and will always be displayed when enabled.

## Usage

### To See All Messages (Current Setting)
```python
LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"  # In config.py
```
This shows:
- ✅ Progress bars
- ✅ Important status messages (INFO)
- ✅ Verbose operations (DEBUG)
- ✅ Error messages (ERROR)

### To See Only Progress Bars and Important Messages
```python
LOG_LEVEL = "INFO"  # In config.py
```
This shows:
- ✅ Progress bars
- ✅ Important status messages (INFO)
- ❌ Verbose operations (DEBUG) - hidden
- ✅ Error messages (ERROR)

### To See Only Progress Bars and Errors
```python
LOG_LEVEL = "WARNING"  # In config.py
```
This shows:
- ✅ Progress bars
- ❌ Important status messages (INFO) - hidden
- ❌ Verbose operations (DEBUG) - hidden
- ✅ Error messages (ERROR)

## Testing

Run the test script to see the changes in action:
```bash
python test_logging_changes.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Output**: Verbose operations are hidden by default
2. **Progress Focus**: Users see progress bars and important status
3. **Debug Capability**: Full debug information available when needed
4. **Flexible**: Easy to adjust verbosity by changing LOG_LEVEL
5. **Maintained Functionality**: All important information still logged

## Files Modified

1. `config.py` - Changed LOG_LEVEL to "DEBUG"
2. `main.py` - Updated logging setup and moved job log upload to DEBUG
3. `blob_monitor.py` - Moved file operations to DEBUG level
4. `multi_thread_processor.py` - Moved verbose operations to DEBUG level
5. `document_converter.py` - Moved cleanup messages to DEBUG level
6. `trigger_file_handler.py` - Moved validation details to DEBUG level
7. `batch_processor.py` - Moved memory cleanup to DEBUG level

## Recommendation

For production use, consider setting `LOG_LEVEL = "INFO"` to show only progress bars and important status messages without the verbose debug information.
